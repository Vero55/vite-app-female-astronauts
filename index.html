        <p>Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman in space aboard Vostok 6 in 1963, the then-Soviet Union's spacecraft.</p>

        <h2>🕰️ History</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Over the past half-century, 64 women have followed Tereshkova into space, though with varying degrees of success. 
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Svetlana Savitskaya</em>  was the second woman in space in 1982, 20 years after Tereshkova's flight. Two years later, she earned the title of being the first woman to walk in space.
          Until 1982, women were not qualified as space pilots or workers on a par with men.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Sally Ride</em> became the first American woman in space as part of the STS-7 mission in June 1983.

          <br><br>
          The following year, 🚀 <em>Kathryn Sullivan</em> walked in space as the first American woman in history. 
          <br><br>
          As the first British astronaut in space, 🚀 <em>Helen Sharman</em> holds a remarkable distinction. Sharman also became the first woman to visit the Russian space station Mir during her sojourn in 1991.
          <hr>
          🚀 <em>Mae Jemison</em>: Mission specialist on STS-47. The first African American woman in space.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Chiaki Mukai</em>: The first woman to command a Russian Soyuz capsule during re-entry. Japanese national, the first Asian woman in space in 1994.
          <br><br> 
          🚀 <em>Peggy Whitson</em>: The first female commander of an expedition on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2000. She holds the US record for cumulative time in space with 665 days spent in space. Anousheh Ansari became not only the first Iranian-born woman in space but also the first self-funded woman to fly to the ISS in 2006.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Susan Helms</em>: The first female NASA astronaut aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in 2001. She set the world record for the longest single spacewalk at 8 hours and 56 minutes.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Anousheh Ansari</em>: The first Iranian-born woman in space and the first self-funded woman to fly to the ISS in 2006.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Sunita Williams</em>: flew into space for the first time in 2007, set the record for the longest space flight by a woman at the time and completed seven spacewalks.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Tracy Caldwell Dyson, Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger, Stephanie Wilson and Naoko Yamazaki (Japan)</em>: for the first and so far only time, four women were in space at the same time in 2010.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Liu Yang</em>: The first Chinese woman in space in 2012 aboard the Shenzhou-9 spacecraft, which docked with the Tiangong-1 space station.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Wang Yaping</em>: The second Chinese woman spacewalker, she thought schoolchildren live from the station in 2013.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Samantha Cristoforetti</em>: supported biology, human physiology, radiation research. The first Italian woman in space in 2014. 
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Muthayya Vanitha and Ritu Karidhal</em>: India’s second Moon lander mission in 2019 was led (remotely) by these two remarkable women.

        <h2>👩🏽 🚀 To date, women make up only slightly more than 10 percent of human space travellers.</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          In recent years, manned spaceflight has become more frequent and multinational, and the role of women space travellers from around the world has grown in parallel.
        </p>
        <h2>🌘 Returning to the Moon 💫</h2>
        <p>
          There are 13 different regions near the lunar south pole where the first woman and the next man could land on the Moon by the Artemis mission NASA III in 2025.
          <br><br>
          The announcement comes as NASA prepares for the launch of Artemis I, the first unmanned mission that will set out Aug. 29 on a trip around the Moon. The first mission will test the new Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft and other components before launching crewed Artemis II and Artemis III missions planned for 2024 and 2025.
          The Artemis program is intended to return humans to the Moon in the long term and eventually pave the way for manned missions to Mars.
          <br><br>
          While Artemis II will take a human crew on a journey around the Moon, Artemis III will be the first mission to return humans to the lunar surface since Apollo 17 in 1972.

        <h2> 👩🏽 🚀 What You Should Know About The Physical Effects Of Space On Women</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>General health</h3>
        <p>
          The same physical effects are experienced by women as by men in spaceflight. There are changes to the health of the body due to weightlessness and other risks such as vacuum and temperature. 
          <br><br>
          NASA reports suggested that menstruation could pose a health risk or negatively affect performance but it has been addressed now. The space suit for outdoor activities has been rethought since the introduction of women into space, in regard to the need for clothing that was previously designed for men. 
          In the development of space toilets, there was no consideration given to women until the first better-designed toilets for women and men were delivered to the space station in October 2020. 
        </p>
        <h3>Radiation</h3>
        <p>
          Both men and women are affected by radiation. Massive particles are troublesome for astronauts outside of the magnetic field of Earth because they get solar particles from solar protons events and galactic particles from other sources. 
          <br><br>
          The risk of serious health issues for astronauts traveling to the Moon or other distant locations beyond the Earth's equator has increased because of these charged nuclei blocking Earth's magnetic field. There is a possibility that a radiation level from a solar particle event can be lethal to a person not wearing a helmet. 
        </p>
        <h3>Pregnancy</h3>
        <p>
          NASA women can only spend half as much time on the mission as men as some risk models currently use for breast, ovarian, and uterus tumors, limiting their career opportunities compared to men. A study published in the International Journal of Immunology Research in 2005 found that short-duration tasks did have no effect on a woman's ability to conceive or have a baby. 
          <br><br>
          NASA does not allow pregnant astronauts to fly in space. Some scientific experiments have looked at several aspects of pregnancy. Radiation increases the risk of cancer in the fetus. Babies born to astronauts can be infertile if they are exposed to too much radiation. If a woman is pregnant, ionizing radiation can destroy the fetus' eggs, leaving the offspring infertile when they grow up. 
          <br><br>
          Scientists conducted pregnancy experiments in mammals that were not human, despite no humans being pregnant in space. Space missions have researched "mammalian reproduction and growth" and include the space shuttle missions.
          <br><br>
          The performance of long-term space missions has been affected by a lack of knowledge about pregnancies and birth control in zero gravity.
          During a space shuttle mission in 1998, mother rats were found to not be providing adequate nutrition or feeding their offspring in space. Rats that were pregnant were shown in a study to be able to give birth successfully and suckle normally. 
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Children</h3>
        <p>
          No child has been born in space and no child has left the planet. Some people have considered creating a program that would allow children of families to move into space.
