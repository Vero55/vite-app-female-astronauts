        <h2>🕰️ History</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Over the past half-century, 64 women have followed Tereshkova into space, though with varying degrees of success. 
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Svetlana Savitskaya</em>  was the second woman in space in 1982, 20 years after Tereshkova's flight. Two years later, she earned the title of being the first woman to walk in space.
          Until 1982, women were not qualified as space pilots or workers on a par with men.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Sally Ride</em> became the first American woman in space as part of the STS-7 mission in June 1983.

          <br><br>
          The following year, 🚀 <em>Kathryn Sullivan</em> walked in space as the first American woman in history. 
          <br><br>
          As the first British astronaut in space, 🚀 <em>Helen Sharman</em> holds a remarkable distinction. Sharman also became the first woman to visit the Russian space station Mir during her sojourn in 1991.
          <hr>
          🚀 <em>Mae Jemison</em>: Mission specialist on STS-47. The first African American woman in space.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Chiaki Mukai</em>: The first woman to command a Russian Soyuz capsule during re-entry. Japanese national, the first Asian woman in space in 1994.
          <br><br> 
          🚀 <em>Peggy Whitson</em>: The first female commander of an expedition on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2000. She holds the US record for cumulative time in space with 665 days spent in space. Anousheh Ansari became not only the first Iranian-born woman in space but also the first self-funded woman to fly to the ISS in 2006.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Susan Helms</em>: The first female NASA astronaut aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in 2001. She set the world record for the longest single spacewalk at 8 hours and 56 minutes.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Anousheh Ansari</em>: The first Iranian-born woman in space and the first self-funded woman to fly to the ISS in 2006.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Sunita Williams</em>: flew into space for the first time in 2007, set the record for the longest space flight by a woman at the time and completed seven spacewalks.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Tracy Caldwell Dyson, Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger, Stephanie Wilson and Naoko Yamazaki (Japan)</em>: for the first and so far only time, four women were in space at the same time in 2010.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Liu Yang</em>: The first Chinese woman in space in 2012 aboard the Shenzhou-9 spacecraft, which docked with the Tiangong-1 space station.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Wang Yaping</em>: The second Chinese woman spacewalker, she thought schoolchildren live from the station in 2013.
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Samantha Cristoforetti</em>: supported biology, human physiology, radiation research. The first Italian woman in space in 2014. 
          <br><br>
          🚀 <em>Muthayya Vanitha and Ritu Karidhal</em>: India’s second Moon lander mission in 2019 was led (remotely) by these two remarkable women.

        <h2>👩🏽 🚀 To date, women make up only slightly more than 10 percent of human space travellers.</h2>
        <p>
          In recent years, manned spaceflight has become more frequent and multinational, and the role of women space travellers from around the world has grown in parallel.
        </p>
        <h2>🌘 Returning to the Moon 💫</h2>
        <p>
          There are 13 different regions near the lunar south pole where the first woman and the next man could land on the Moon by the Artemis mission NASA III in 2025.
          <br><br>
          The announcement comes as NASA prepares for the launch of Artemis I, the first unmanned mission that will set out Aug. 29 on a trip around the Moon. The first mission will test the new Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft and other components before launching crewed Artemis II and Artemis III missions planned for 2024 and 2025.
          <br><br>
          The Artemis program is intended to return humans to the Moon in the long term and eventually pave the way for manned missions to Mars.
          <br><br>
          While Artemis II will take a human crew on a journey around the Moon, Artemis III will be the first mission to return humans to the lunar surface since Apollo 17 in 1972.
